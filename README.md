# ANT ENGINE 2D
Ant 2d is a lightweight basic 2d game engine using SFML for rendering, input and audio.
This project isn't intended to actually be used as a game engine but rather it's more of a learning project for me.
The goal is to gain some expereince developing an engine, so then  I can move on to more in depth and bigger projects.
